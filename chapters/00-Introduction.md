## What Is Ruby?

Ruby is a cross-platform interpreted language which has many features in common with other ‘scripting’ languages such as Perl and Python. However, its version of object orientation is more thorough than those languages and, in many respects, it has more in common with the great-granddaddy of ‘pure’ OOP languages, Smalltalk. The Ruby language was created by Yukihiro Matsumoto (commonly known as ‘Matz’) and it was first released in 1995.

## What Is Rails?

Currently much of the excitement surrounding Ruby can be attributed to a web development framework called Rails – popularly known as ‘Ruby On Rails’. While Rails is an impressive framework, it is not the be-all and end-all of Ruby. Indeed, if you decide to leap right into Rails development without first mastering Ruby, you may find that you end up with an application that you don’t even understand. While the Little Book of Ruby won’t cover the special features of Rails, it will give you the grounding you need to understand Rails code and write your own Rails applications.

## Installing And Using Ruby With Ruby In Steel

Ruby In Steel is a Windows-based IDE which comes with an all-in-one installer to install Ruby, Visual Studio, Ruby In Steel and various other optional packages including Rails. Be sure to read the installation guide provided with the software: http://www.sapphiresteel.com.

## Installing Ruby Yourself

If you are using some other IDE or editor, you will need to download the latest version of Ruby from www.ruby-lang.org. Be sure to download the binaries (not merely the source code).

## Get The Source Code Of The Sample Programs

All the programs in every chapter in this book are available for download as a Zip archive from http://www.sapphiresteel.com/The-Little-Book-Of-Ruby. When you unzip the programs you will find that they are grouped into a set of directories – one for each chapter. If you are using Ruby In Steel, you will be able to load all the programs as a single solution, with the programs for each chapter arranged on the branches of a tree in the Project Manager.

## Running Ruby Programs

It is often useful to keep a Command window open in the source directory containing your Ruby program files. Assuming that the Ruby interpreter is correctly pathed on your system, you will then be able to run programs by entering _ruby <program name>_ like this:

```roby
ruby 1helloworld.rb
```

If you are using Ruby In Steel you can run the programs in the interactive console by pressing CTRL+F5 or (in some editions) you may run them in the debugger by pressing F5.

## How To Use This Book

This book is a step-by-step tutorial to programming in Ruby and you can follow it chapter by chapter, reading the text and running the sample programs. On the other hand, if you prefer to ‘dip in’, you may want to try out some of the programs in whichever order takes your fancy; then refer back to the text for explanations. There are no monolithic applications in this book – just small, self-contained sample programs – so it’s easy to skip from chapter to chapter if you wish…

## Making Sense Of The Text

In The Little Book Of Ruby, any Ruby source code is written like this:

```ruby
def saysomething
  puts( "Hello" )
end
```

When there is a sample program to accompany the code, the program name is
shown in a little box like this:

**helloname.rb**

Explanatory notes (which generally provide some hints or give a more in- depth explanation of some point mentioned in the text) are shown in a shaded box like this:

> This is an explanatory note. You can skip it if you like – but if you do so, you may miss something of interest<!
